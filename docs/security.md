# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security considerations and best practices for the ChainFinity project.

## Security Principles

1. **Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
3. **Secure by Default**: Safe configurations out of the box
4. **Zero Trust**: Verify everything, trust nothing

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use JWT for API authentication
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Enforce strong password policies
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Use secure session management

## Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use TLS for all communications
- Implement proper key management
- Regular data backups
- Data minimization principles

## Smart Contract Security

- Follow best practices for smart contract development
- Regular security audits
- Use established patterns and libraries
- Implement proper access controls
- Test thoroughly before deployment

## API Security

- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- CORS configuration
- API versioning
- Error handling without sensitive data exposure

## Infrastructure Security

- Regular security updates
- Network segmentation
- Firewall configuration
- Intrusion detection
- Logging and monitoring

## Development Security

- Secure coding practices
- Dependency scanning
- Code review process
- Automated security testing
- Regular security training

## Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Monitor for security incidents
2. **Response**: Immediate action plan
3. **Containment**: Limit impact
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve
